# ðŸ’¬ About Me

I am an undergraduate student studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am also a team lead of UIUC's VEXU competition team and an undergraduate researcher working with the Bretl Research Group at UIUC.

## ðŸ¤– VEX Robotics Competition

I started competing in the VEX Robotics Competition in 2018, my junior year of high school. I was part of Maryland team 97963A for both seasons before graduating, winning two out of the three regional tournaments attended in my rookie year and winning the state championship in my second year ([here](https://youtu.be/Z1pic_nTj8M) is the programming skills routine I ran at states). 

After entering college, I joined UIUC's VEXU team to continue my competition career. During the 2020-2021 season, our team maxed out the programming skills challenge (iterations [1](https://youtu.be/lbfCjw0BKeE), [2](https://youtu.be/1y09uk4Njgk), and [3](https://youtu.be/Oa5fJqwaVGs)) and won the Robot Skills Champion title at the tournament hosted by UNL. 

As college classes and activities became more time demanding after my freshman year, my direct involvement in the VEX Robotics Competition has decreased significantly. Now I mainly work with the programming team to make our robot perform tasks more accurately and efficiently in autonomous mode. When time permits, I also work on [interactive demos](https://github.com/ambulocetus18/vrc_demos) (written with Python and Jupyter notebook) for basic mobile robot movement algorithms to help those new to the community get started.

## ðŸ“š Undergraduate Research

I am currently an undergraduate researcher working on deformable linear object perception and tracking. Perception and tracking of deformable objects are more difficult than that of rigid objects because their shapes change under contact and they are often exposed to occlusion and self-occlusion. In the past, I have assisted in the creation of a deformable linear object dataset. Now I mainly work with deformable linear object tracking algorithms in hopes of increasing their robustness when the object is partially occluded.
